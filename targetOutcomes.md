For this article you should focus on the findings of Experiment 1 reported in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.2. Results and discussion
If children infer preference from a single action, they should be more likely to indicate the worse toy when the agent takes this toy compared to when the agent does not take a toy. To examine this, children were scored 1 each time they indicated the worse toy, and 0 each time they indicated the better toy (maximum score = 2). Children’s mean scores are shown in Fig. 2.

> A 2 (condition: action, no-action) × 2 (age: 3, 4) ANOVA revealed a main effect of condition, F(1, 76) = 47.88, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.39, an age by condition interaction, F(1, 76) = 5.32, p = 0.024, ηp2 = 0.07, and no effect of age, F(1, 76) = 0.98, p = 0.326. The main effect of condition resulted because children were more likely to indicate the worse toy when the agent took this toy than when the agent did not take a toy from the shelf.
Follow-up analyses indicated that the difference between the conditions emerged in both age groups: 3-year-olds, t(38) = 2.82, p = 0.008, d = 0.91; 4-year-olds, t(38) = 8.05, p < 0.001, d = 2.61. These analyses also revealed that the interaction between age and condition resulted from children at both ages indicating the worse toy at similar rates in the no-action condition, t(38) = 1.08, p = 0.288, but 4-year-olds indicating it more than 3-year-olds in the action condition, t(38) = −2.08, p = 0.044, d = 0.67.
